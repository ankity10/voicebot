## Steps to Use a Voice Agent

1. ### [Create voice agent](create-voice-agent.md)
   - A voice agent is an object that includes LLM information such as the LLM provider and the specific model to be used, along with a behavior prompt and details about the speech-to-text (STT) and text-to-speech (TTS) models. [Learn More](create-voice-agent.md)
   
2. ### [Add function](adding%20functions.md)
   - A function allows an LLM to interact with other software systems using REST API calls. [Learn More](adding%20functions.md)
3. ### [Add knowledge base](Add%20Knowledgebase.md)

4. ### [Receive inbound calls](Inbound%20Calls%20with%20Voiceagent.md)
